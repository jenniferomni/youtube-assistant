1.Create a virtual environment (.venv)

2.Then, run the app using the command:
streamlit run main.py

The Cohere API key is already included in the code. Although it is free of cost, 
it is better to not share it with others. If you want to use your own key, 
you can replace it in the code. You can add it as an environmental variable by creating a .env file.

3. After running the app, you will see a webpage with a text box and a button. Add your youtube url. Hit Enter key.
It will parse the video transcript and save it as a .txt file. File will be saved in the same directory as main.py.
The chatbot will answer questions based on this file.
You can enter your question in the text box and click the button to get the answer. 
The answer will be displayed below the button.

4.The chatbot feature works but the video info feature where the language and title of the video gets 
displayed on the left side bar does not.
