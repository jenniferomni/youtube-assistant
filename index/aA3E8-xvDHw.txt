when I first visited Gandhi in 1942 at his asham in seam he said I will tell you how it happened that I decided to urge the departure of the British it was in 1917 he had gone to the December 1916 annual meeting of the Indian National Congress in LNO there were 2,31 representatives and many visitors a peasant came up to me he said I am R Kumar shuk I am from champan and I want you to come to my district gandi had never heard of that place it was in the foothills of the Himalayas at that time the champ peasants were sharecroppers means they got only a share of the crops Rajkumar was one of them he was illiterate but determined he had come to the Congress session to complain about the Injustice of the landlord system in Bihar and somebody probably had suggested him to go to gandi rkumar I have an appointment in kour and I also have to go to other parts of India I'll accompany you the peasant accompanied him everywhere at last Gandhi returned to the ashram near aabad Rajkumar followed him to his asham for weeks he stayed there there fix a dates Gandhi was impressed by his determination I have to be in Kolkata on such an such a date come and meet me and take me from there months passed when Gandhi arrived at the appointment in Kolkata he waited till Gandhi was free then they both boarded a train for the city of PNA in bhar there Rajkumar led him to the house of a lawyer named rendra Prasad yes the one who later became the first President of India he was out of the town but the servants knew Rajkumar as a poor landlord who Disturbed regen Prasad to help the Indigo Sher cers so they let him and His companion Gandhi to stay there but they thought of Gandhi to be another peasant Gandhi was not permitted to draw water from the well they didn't know if he was untouched able or not if he were some drops from his bucket could pollute the entire Source Gandhi decided to go to mus farer which was on the way to chaerin to obtain more complete information about the conditions he sent a telegram to Professor J B creeper Laney of the arts college in muf farer the train reached at midnight on the 15th of April 1917 at the station creep elany was standing with a large group of boys Gandhi stayed there for 2 days where in the home of Professor malani a teacher in a government school it was an extraordinary thing in those days for a government Professor to give shelter to a man like me but Professor morinii let me stay the news of Gandhi's arrival spread quickly through mus farer and also to cherin sharecroppers from cherin and lawyers of M farer met him the lawyers frequently fought cases in the court for the peasants they told him about their cases and reported the size of their fee you shouldn't collect such big fee from the sharecroppers I have come to the conclusion that we should stop going Law Courts taking such cases to the Law Courts does no good where the peasants are so crushed and fear stricken Law Courts are useless the real relief for them is to be free from Fear the crop land in chaperon was divided into large Estates owned by English men and worked by Indian peasants the chief commercial crop was Indigo the landlords forced them to plant 3 20ths of their land that is 15 % of their land with Indigo and give all the Indigo Harvest as rent then the landlords came to know that Germany had developed synthetic Indigo Indigo Plantation was not profitable anymore now the peasants had to pay them compensation for being released from the 15% system the Sherry cropping Arrangement was Troublesome to The Peasants still many agreed those who opposed were tortured by thugs hired by the landlords meanwhile the information about synthetic Indigo reached illiterate peasants now they wanted their money back at this point Gandhi arrived in chaerin he began by trying to get the facts first he visited the secretary of the British landlords Association we can't give information to an outsider I am not an out cider next he went to the British official commissioner of the tiar Hut Division Chapin District laid in the tear Hut Division the commissioner began to frighten me and advised me to leave the Hut he didn't leave instead he proceeded to modari the capital of cherin at the station a huge crowd greeted him he went to a house and using it as headquarters continued his investigations a report came in that a peasant had been maltreated in a village nearby Gandhi decided to go and see the next morning he started out on the back of an elephant on the way a messenger of the Police Superintendent ordered him to return to his town Gandhi obeyed he was served a notice to leave cherin immediately Gandhi signed a receip for the notice and wrote on it that he would disobey the order because of this Gandhi received a Court's order to appear in the court next day all night he remained awake he telegraphed rendra to come with his influential friends he sent instructions to the ashram he wired a full report to the vicroy the next morning thousands of peasants demonstrated to support Gandhi their demonstration around the courthouse was the beginning of their Liberation from Fear of the British the officials felt helpless Gandhi helped to control the crowd he was polite and friendly the government was baffled the government's Advocate requested the judge to postpone the trial Gandhi protested against the delay he made the statement I was involved in a conflict of duties on one hand I had the duty not to set a bad example as a law breaker on the other hand I had the duty to do the Humane and national service for which I had come to fight for justice of the sharecroppers I disobeyed the order to leave champaran not because of lack of respect for lawful Authority but to obey the higher law of our being the voice of in a being I accept my fault I will pronounce the sentence after a 2-hour recess you have to present your bail for those 2 hours bail means security for release I can't give any bail the judge released him without a bail when the court was reconvened after 2 hours he said I will not deliver any judgment for some days for that period Gandhi will remain in Liberty rendra Bri Babu Maan asaru and several other lawyers had arrived they discussed with Gandhi what would you do if I were sentenced to prison the senior lawyer said we had come to advise and help you if you went to jail there would be nobody to advise and we would go home what about the Injustice to the shoers after the consultations regener concluded they thought amongst themselves that gandi was totally a stranger he was prepared to go to prison for the sake of peasants they are being not only residents of the nearby districts but also those have claimed to help the peasants if they should go home it would be a shameful leaving they all went back to Gandhi and told him that if he would be sentenced to prison in the next trial they were ready to follow him into jail seeing their cooperation he exclaimed the Battle of champaran is won he took a piece of paper and divided the group into Pairs and put down the arrangement in which each pair would surrender in the court several days later Gandhi received a letter from the magistrate informing him that the lieutenant governor had ordered the case to be dropped Civil Disobedience had triumphed first time in Modern India now Gandhi and the lawyers began to conduct investigation into the complaints of the peasants evidences by about 10,000 peasants were written down documents were collected the whole area trembled by the activity of investigators and violent protests of the landlords in June Gandhi was summoned to Sir Edward gate the lieutenant governor summon means to order to be present before going to him Gandhi met the leading Companions and again detailed plans for civil disobedience if he shouldn't return there he had four interviews with the lieutenant governor as a result the lieutenant governor appointed an official Commission of inquiry into the Indigo sherer's situation the commission consisted of landlords government officials and Gandhi as the only representative of the peasants he remained in chaperon for straight 7 months and then again for some shorter visits the visit undertaken casually because of the request of a peasant in the expectation that it would last a few days occupied almost a year of Gandhi's life the official inquiry collected a mountain of evidence against the big landlords when they saw this they agreed to make refunds to The Peasants but how much must we pay they thought he would demand repayment in full of the money which they had illegally and forcefully taken from the Sher robers 50% Jay Z HJ a British missionary wrote on this event there Gandhi seemed fixed thinking that he would not surrender the representative of the landlords offered to return to the extent of 25% and to his amazement Mr Gandhi agreed thus breaking the confusion the amount of refund is less important and the fact that the landlords were forced to surrender part of their money and with it part of their honor therefore as far as the peasants are concerned the landlords have behaved as Lords above law now the peasant can see that he have rights he has learned courage events proved Gandhi's position within a few years the British landlords abandoned their Estates which were given back to the peasants Indigo Sherry cropping disappeared Gandhi Never Satisfied himself with large political or economic Solutions he saw the cultural and social backwardness in The cherine Villages and wanted to do something immediately MF Desai and narhari peric two young men who had just joined gandi as disciples with their wives offered for the work several more came from Bombay Puna and other parts Gandhi's wife castra by with her son dadas also arrived from the ashram primary schools were opened in six Villages Caster by taught the ashram rules on personal cleanliness and Community sanitation health conditions were miserable Gandhi got a doctor to provide services for 6 months three medicines were available castor oil quinine and sulfur ointment anybody who showed a coated tongue was given castor oil anybody body with malaria fever was given Quine plus castor oil anybody with skin rashes was given sulfur ointment plus castor oil Gandhi noticed the dirty state of women's clothes he asked cter by to talk to them about it one woman took her into her Hut and said look there is no box or covered here for clothes the S I'm wearing is the only one I have during his long stay in chaerin Gandhi kept a remote watch on his ashram he sent regular instructions and asked for financial accounts once he wrote to the residents that it was time to fill in the old latrine gutters and dig new ones otherwise the old ones would begin to smell bad the chaerin episode was a turning point in Gandhi's life what I did was a very ordinary thing I declared said that the British could not order me about in my own country chapon did not begin as an act of Disobedience rather it grew out of an effort to remove the trouble of large numbers of poor peasants this was the typical Gandhi method his politics were mixed up with the Practical day-to-day problems of the millions he was not a loyalty to imaginary things he was loyal to living human beings in everything he did he tried to make a new free Indian who could stand on his own feet and thus make India free early in chaper in action CF Andrews the English pacifist pacifist means one who was against Wars who had become his follower came to meet Gandhi before going to the Fiji islands Gandhi's lawyer friends thought it would be a good idea for Andrews to stay in chapon and help them Andrews was willing if Gandhi agreed but Gandhi opposed he said to the lawyers you think in this unequal fight it will be helpful if we have an Englishman on our side this shows the weakness of your heart the cause is fair and you must rely on yourself to win the battle you must not see a support in Mr Andrews because he is an Englishman regend prid comments he had read out Minds correctly and we had no reply Gandy in this way taught us a lesson in self-reliance self-reliance Indian independence and help to sheriff robers were all bound together
